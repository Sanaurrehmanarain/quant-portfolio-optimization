# Quantitative Portfolio Optimization & Factor Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive, end-to-end quantitative portfolio management project. It explores advanced asset allocation techniques, transitioning from traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to factor-based risk analysis, Monte Carlo simulation boundaries, and finally, the implementation of the Black-Litterman model to incorporate subjective market views.

## Project Architecture
The analysis is structured into four core phases, coded entirely in Python using Jupyter Notebooks:

### 1. Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
Calculates the optimal asset weights for a 10-stock universe (TSLA, WMT, BAC, GS, LLY, MRK, GOOG, META, AAPL, XOM) by maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
* Evaluates the mathematical impact of unconstrained vs. constrained (18% maximum weight) capital allocation.
* Visualizes the nested Efficient Frontiers.
* Conducts strict **Out-of-Sample testing** to demonstrate the dangers of overfitting and the real-world value of diversification constraints (evaluating Cumulative Returns, Sharpe Ratios, and Max Drawdown).

### 2. Fama-French 5-Factor Style Analysis
Deconstructs the constrained portfolio's historical returns to determine its underlying investment style.
* Extracts daily Fama-French data (Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA) using pandas-datareader.
* Compares Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with Huber's T Robust Linear Regression to account for fat-tailed market anomalies.
* Validates the regression model's predictive power on unseen Out-of-Sample data.

### 3. Hard Optimization vs. Monte Carlo Simulations
Investigates the computational efficiency and mathematical limitations of random simulation.
* Processes hundreds of thousands of simulated portfolios to map the feasible region of risk/return.
* Demonstrates the "Curse of Dimensionality" and high rejection rates when applying strict box constraints to random sampling compared to SLSQP algorithmic optimization.

### 4. The Black-Litterman Model
Resolves the estimation-error maximization problem inherent in traditional Markowitz optimization by blending market equilibrium with subjective manager views.
* Constructs a synthetic market composite using the S&P 500 (SPY).
* Translates absolute and relative market views into matrix algebra ($P$ and $Q$ matrices).
* Calculates posterior expected returns ($\mu_{BL}$) and covariance ($\Sigma_{BL}$) to output a balanced, intuitive asset allocation.
